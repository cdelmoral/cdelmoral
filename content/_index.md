Hola!

My name is Carlos. I'm a full-stack software engineer at
[Komodo Health](https://komodohealth.com) where I design and build web
applications used by some of the top pharmaceutical companies around the world.

When I'm not in front of the computer you can find me on the tennis courts,
on stage behind the drums, or just taking photos with my camera.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can do so through LinkedIn.

Cheers!
